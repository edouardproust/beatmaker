This application is useful for musicians or singers to create a rhythmic background to accompany a composition or a practice session.

Click on the colored pads to add a sound. By clicking on "Play" the sound loop will be started and the sound will be played when the loop passes over the selected pad.

Then you can set the following parameters:
- Define the tempo
- Sounds for each track (a select menu offers several choices for each track)
- Mute or unmute each track
